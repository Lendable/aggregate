Lendable Library Template
====================
A template repository for creating new PHP libraries

## Installation
This repository is private, so you will need to add a definition to your 
`composer.json`'s `repositories` section.

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url":  "git@github.com:Lendable/aggregate.git"
        }
    ]
}
```

You can then install the library.

```bash
composer require lendable/aggregate
```

## Requirements
* PHP 7.4
